# Caster

This is a simple keystroke overlay I built.

# Contributing

I won't accept issues nor pull requests to this project. It literally doesn't
have a license. Do whatever you want with it. I built it for a very specific
need I had and won't be maintaining it actively as a project.

# Found a bug?

Sounds like a _you_ problem. I truly couldn't care less lol.

# Like to request a feature?

Fork and do it yourself. Can't? Skill issue ðŸ’€.
